Q2: Do Django signals run in the same thread as the caller?
Answer : Yes, Django run in the same thread as the caller unless explicitly executed asynchronously.

1. The function signal_handler in the program prints the thread name.
2. The main thread name is printed before and after saving a user.
3. Since both outputs will match, it confirms that Django signals run in same thread.
