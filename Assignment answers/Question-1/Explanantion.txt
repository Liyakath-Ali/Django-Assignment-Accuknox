Q1 : Are Django signals Executed synchronously or asynchronously?
Answer: By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. This means that the signal handlers are executed in the same thread and process as the event that triggered them.

1. We define a signal handler for post_save of the user model.
2. We print the current thread in both the main function and the signal handler.
3. Since the output will show the same thread name for both, it proves that signals execute synchronously.
